# Sextant

## A ReactiveUI navigation library for Xamarin.Forms

Sextant was born from a fork of [Xamvvm](https://github.com/xamvvm/xamvvm) which is nice and simple MVVM Framework with a good navigation system.
The problem is, I just wanted a simple navigation system to use with [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) without all the things that come along an MVVM framework. Plus, I wanted to make it more "Reactive Friendly".

Sextant is in a very initial stage, where it is pretty much a stripped out version of [Xamvvm](https://github.com/xamvvm/xamvvm) so it could be used right away in my projects, but we have to start somewhere, right?! :)

This library is nothing more than me "standing on the shoulders of giants":
[Daniel Luberda](https://github.com/luberda-molinet) and [Thomas Burkhart](https://github.com/escamoteur) creator of Xamvvm](https://github.com/xamvvm/xamvvm)
[Geoffrey Huntley](https://github.com/ghuntley) maintainer on [ReactiveUI](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI) (especially the build.cake) from where learned a lot about Cake + AppVeyor
